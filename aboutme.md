title: Who is Harrison?
subtitle:

My name is Harrison Chaney, and I am on a journey through the amazing world of embedded systems. I am currently a graduate student at Virginia Tech. My research involves simulating molecular movement. I learned about embedded systems by helping my group members in pulling sensor data from experiments and designing devices for automated sample preparation. 

Some stuff about me:

- Big fan of low level Coding 
- Basically spent the last year parsing files with python... 
- I really love rock climbing 
- Wrestled for many years 
- I love building things with my hands 
- Interested in ROM hacking retro gaming consoles such as the GBA
 

### Why Embedded? 
I love how cross discipline embedded can be. I can spend a day making cases on FreeCAD and schematics/PCBs in kiCAD. If I am tired of drawing designs I can always code up some new ideas on the hardware I already made. Some days I just want to solder and create the circuits by hand and embedded projects give me that freedom.  

I try to keep my projects open ended on the software side which allows me to implement a few different programs on the piece of hardware.
