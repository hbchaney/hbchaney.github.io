My name is Harrison Chaney and I am on a journey through the amazing world of embedded systems. 

Here is a little about me: 

- Big fan of low level Coding 
- Basically spend the last year parsing files with python... 
- I really love rock climbing 
- Wrestled for many years 
 

### Why Embedded? 
I love how cross discipline embedded can be. I can spend a day making cases on FreeCAD and schematics/PCB in kiCAD. If I am tired of Drawing designs I can always code up some new ideas on the hardware I already made. Some days I just want to solder and create the circuits by hand and embedded projects give me that freedom.  

I try to keep my projects open ended on the software side which allows me to implement a few different programs on the piece of hardware.
