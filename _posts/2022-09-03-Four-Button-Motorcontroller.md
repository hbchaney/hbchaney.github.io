## Microcontroller - Showcase

![Four Button Motor Driver](https://github.com/hbchaney/hbchaney.github.io/blob/master/assets/img/Motor_Controller/20220901_113526.jpg?raw=true){: width="50%" :}

### Overview 

The parts consist of the MOSFET based TB6612 motor controller and a metro mini. The reason I decided to stick with arduino framework on this one is because I want other people in my group to be able to reprogram the device when I am gone.The reason why it needs four buttons is  to allow for real time calibrating of the device if needed. 

Once it is setup, I will take a picture of it with the motor in action.
