## Microcontroller - Showcase

### Overview 

The parts consist of the MOSFET based TB6612 motor controller and a metro mini. The reason I decided to stick with arduino framework on this one is because I want to be able to reprogram the device when I am gone.The reason why it needs for buttons is  to allow for real time calibrating of the device if needed.
