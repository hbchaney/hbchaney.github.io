## Walk Through - Hardware

### Overview 
The LED cube is a bicolor square profile LED screen with a rotary Encoder acting as the user interface. All housed in a 3d printed cuboidal shape before being braised and seared to a mouth watering meduim rare. Serve with your choice of lead solder, brioche roll, and usb power/data cable. Enjoy!

### Schematic 
Here is an overall schematic on how the parts will be connected. The pins chosen for the button and buzzer are flexible.

### Attaching the parts together 

A choice must be made for how to connect the microcontroller to the hardware. There are 3 inputpullup pins required for the Rotary Encoder and 2 GND pins. For the LED screen, it is a I2C interface so you will need a clock and data pin as well as a VCC and GND pin to provide the power. PLEASE DOUBLE CHECK THE DIAGRAM before soldering. 

Here are some options:  

- solder wires directly to the microcontroller  <- Recommended
  
	This is the easiest permanent method. The downside to this method is you cannot test your cube via breadboard before soldering everything together.

- solder pins to microcontroller and components than use female to female wires to connect them.

- solderpins to microcontroller than solderwires to each pin.
